# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

 Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python** – For coding and analysis  
- **Pandas** – For data handling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** – For data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – For machine learning (Linear Regression model, train-test split, evaluation metrics)

# Editor Used:
- Google Colab (Online Jupyter Notebook)

# Project Description:
This is a simple machine learning project where I built a **House Price Prediction model** using **Linear Regression**. The dataset contains information about different house features like:

- Lot Area  
- Overall Quality  
- Year Built  
- Ground Living Area  
- Garage Cars  
- Sale Price (target variable)

# What I Have Done:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Checked for missing values  
3. Selected important features for prediction  
4. Split the data into training and testing sets  
5. Created and trained a **Linear Regression** model  
6. Predicted house prices on the test data  
7. Evaluated the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
8. Visualized the **Actual vs Predicted prices**  
9. Made a prediction for a **new house** based on custom input

# Final Output:
- Model was trained successfully and used to predict the house prices.
- Also predicted the price of a new house using its features.
- **Learned and applied key steps of a Machine Learning pipeline** with a real-world dataset.
